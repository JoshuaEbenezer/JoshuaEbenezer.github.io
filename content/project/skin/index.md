Proposed a novel algorithm for the segmentation of skin lesions. Developed an image pre-processing pipeline, a modified deep learning architecture, and a post-processing method that gave state of the art results and showed an improvement of 7% compared to training the network without pre-processing, using the Keras library with a Tensorflow backend.
