I am a Staff Research Engineer at Samsung Research America's (SRA) Mobile Processor Innovation (MPI) Lab, where I work on exciting commercial projects such as the Night mode on Samsung Flagship Phones. I did my PhD at the Laboratory for Image and Video Engineering ([LIVE](https://live.ece.utexas.edu/)) at UT Austin from 2019-2023 under Professor Alan Bovik. I served as the Assistant Director of LIVE from 2020-2023. I am broadly interested in image and video processing but love solving problems of any nature that involve perception, mathematics, and coding. I received my B.Tech. from IIT Kharagpur, where I was awarded the Nilanjan Ganguly Memorial Award for the best undergraduate thesis and had the 3rd highest GPA in my graduating batch. My PhD thesis focused on video quality assessment for livestreamed high-motion and HDR videos, and was sponsored by Amazon Prime Video. My current work is on computational photography.

For a complete list of my publications, please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=xbQZ-PUAAAAJ&hl=en) page. You can find my CV [here](https://joshuaebenezer.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Being an academic is my vocation, and one that I enjoy immensely. I play the keyboard and the guitar occasionally. I love reading theology, history, philosophy, listening to music that stirs the soul, and getting to travel and experience different cultures and cuisines. During my time at UT Austin, I also served as the President of the Austin chapter of [Bridges International](https://atxbridges.org/), an organization that helps international students build relationships with each other and explore questions of faith and culture.
